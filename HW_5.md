# Budget Analysis
## First I printed off all of the categories of different expenditures

## Then I created the concatenated Transactuion Data Frame, including categorys, amounts, names and dates

![DataFrame] (C:\Users\johnh\Desktop\PREWORK_JSH\Module-5\dataframe.png)

## Printed is the gross income, yearly income, and monthly pay from this particular account

## Next is a DataFrame reflecting this account's spending, large quantities were used for payments. This is an account that perhaps is used to pay down other accounts.

## However the account is used most reptitively for Food and Drink payments. And the month of march was the heaviest spend, this could be a credit card rewards account. Perhaps March was especially busy for the individual, lots of travel and spending.

# Portfolio Planner
As a note, my connection to Alpaca was denied in the middle of analysis. I received this error "HTTPError: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://data.alpaca.markets/v1/bars/1D?symbols=SPY%2CAGG&start=2019-04-21+22%3A36%3A09.544492&end=2020-04-20+22%3A36%3A09.544492"

and this one as well "access key verification failed (Code = 40110000)"


I tried to reset the keys multiple times, and even manually inputting them. Please evaluate my code as if alpaca API was running. I did my best to write code that will reflect without errors and answer questions dilligently.
