# Budget Analysis
## First I printed off all of the categories of different expenditures

## Then I created the concatenated Transactuion Data Frame, including categorys, amounts, names and dates

![DataFrame] (C:\Users\johnh\Desktop\PREWORK_JSH\Module-5\dataframe.png)

## Printed is the gross income, yearly income, and monthly pay from this particular account

## Next is a DataFrame reflecting this account's spending, large quantities were used for payments. This is an account that perhaps is used to pay down other accounts.

## However the account is used most reptitively for Food and Drink payments. And the month of march was the heaviest spend, this could be a credit card rewards account. Perhaps March was especially busy for the individual, lots of travel and spending.

 ## The MonteCarlo simuation returned favorable returns.
